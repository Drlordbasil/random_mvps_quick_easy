# Random MVPs Quick & Easy

A collection of random AI-powered MVP (Minimum Viable Product) scripts created in collaboration with AI. This repository serves as a playground for rapid prototyping and experimental development of various Python-based solutions.

## Overview

This repository contains various standalone scripts and small projects that demonstrate different concepts, algorithms, and integrations. Each script is designed to be self-contained and easily executable.

## Features

- Python 3.12 based implementations
- Self-contained scripts for various use cases
- Modern and efficient code practices
- Comprehensive documentation for each MVP
- Test-driven development approach

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Dependencies are specified in each project's requirements.txt

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drlordbasil/random_mvps_quick_easy.git
cd random_mvps_quick_easy
```

## Usage

Each script in this repository is independent and contains its own documentation and usage instructions. Navigate to specific script directories for detailed information.
