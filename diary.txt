Update: Enhanced AI Integration

Added interactive AI capabilities to the Co-Artist app:
- New AIFeedbackPanel class for displaying AI feedback and suggestions
- AI can now directly control the canvas through structured commands
- Improved UI with split panel design (canvas on left, AI feedback on right)
- AI suggestions can be applied or ignored by the user
- AI feedback includes both general analysis and specific actionable improvements

The AI integration now allows for:
- Real-time feedback on artwork
- Direct pixel manipulation through AI suggestions
- Color recommendations
- Composition improvements
- Interactive AI-user collaboration

Next potential improvements:
